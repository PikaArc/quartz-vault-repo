# Session Overview

- We were woken up by [[Stretch|Stretch]] who threw the corpse of [[Dris|Dris]] into the room of [[Arcafang|Arcafang]] 
- [[Arcafang|Arcafang]] was accused of the murder
- [[Fanlyn|Fanlyn]] investigated the corpse and the wounds are either made by a scapel or dagger and that the murder wasn't longer than 3 hours ago, alongside of the corpse there was some kind of dust ontop of the corpse
- The location where the corpse of [[Dris|Dris]] was originally found also had a sigil lying on the floor
- Max decided to get something to eat from the nearby shop, disappointed as they only had meat
- [[Fanlyn|Fanlyn]] decided to go get berries seperately
- [[Fanlyn|Fanlyn]] noticed something stretching out of the ground near one of the houses
- After Fanlyn and Max returned seperately [[Stretch|Stretch]] came into the inn with a woman, whose daughter apparently went missing
- The rest of the group decided to question [[Stretch|Stretch]] with various questions
- [[Fanlyn|Fanlyn]] tried to comfort her and asked where her daughter was last seen, the house was next to the thing [[Fanlyn|Fanlyn]] noticed as she went and gather berries 
- [[Fanlyn|Fanlyn]] investigated the house, finding nothing at first, however she noticed the foot tracks of a [[Goblin|Goblin]] outside the house, she decides to follow them
- In the meantime the rest of the group start to question [[Stretch|Stretch]] and follow him
- Max however casted [[Speak with Animals|Speak with Animals]] in the meantime and asked the horses if they had seen something
- [[Fanlyn|Fanlyn]]  followed the foot tracks and it lead to the same thing [[Fanlyn|Fanlyn]] noticed earlier
- She notices that something small, in particular a [[Goblin|Goblin]], was buried in that area
- Along the goblin there was also the same kind of sigil they found earlier. The same dust as before could be seen ontop of the goblin, although faintly
- [[Ntyss|Ntyss]] fell suddenly asleep, Max decided to carry him on his shoulder but dropped him later
- We heard horns from a troupe in the distance of someone announcing their approach
- [[Fanlyn|Fanlyn]] reassured [[Aleesia Enmar|Aleesia Enmar]] that they will look out for her daughter 
- [[Aleesia Enmar|Aleesia Enmar]] also mentioned her husband is also gone for a while, she mentioned he was a hunter
- Shortly after the troupe arrived and discussed something with one of the villagers, afterwards they departed again
- Suddenly the husband of [[Aleesia Enmar|Aleesia Enmar]] seems to have come back from his hunt
- Fanlyn decided to knock on the door, the husband came out and looks sad after learning the situation with his daughter 
- The husband mentioned he killed the goblin, but there was a shadow with the goblin as he killed it
- He recognized the sigil as the symbol of the church
- We ventured north west to a dead forest, its energy drawn to a building in the middle of the forest, which [[Fanlyn|Fanlyn]] was furious at
- At the building there was Armand Clarrel, who recognized Ntyss and recognized where Max and [[Arcafang|Arcafang]] come from, he however does not seem to be able to pin point where [[Fanlyn|Fanlyn]] comes from 
- He explained that the energy was drawn to the building to resurrect Noswada
- We entered the building, finding a sacatomb, with 4 altars around it, we also see 4 smaller sacatombs across the 4 corners
- He read a paragraph from a stone tablet, and then he placed hearts on each altar to break the spell
- Unfortunately nothing happened, besides all 4 doors closing shut
- Fanlyn went around and investigated the 4 coffins in the corners 
- She figured this out: 
>   North East: XXkoa
South East: NXdri
South West: OrtaX
North West: Unknown 

- Max investigated the right statue, which raised its head 
- After a bit [[Fanlyn|Fanlyn]] investigated the left statue, detecting it's receiving energy from the tomb
- The solution of the puzzle was to rotate the altars and its letters to each responding coffin where the letters were missing
- The doors opened... but the left statue started to animate as it started to grab the sword on the stone where the paragraph was written
- The man that was with us mentioned that Noswada seemingly transferred his soul into the statue 
- Hitting the tomb seems to weaken the link between the tomb and the statue
- Max and [[Arcafang|Arcafang]] decided to run 
- Max although decided to come back while Arcafang went and tried to get backup
- [[Ntyss|Ntyss]] and [[Fanlyn|Fanlyn]] decided to hit the the tomb
- After enough strikes the top of the tomb fell off, which the statue reacted with a roar. In the tomb was a corpse, likely of  Noswada 
- Noswada wanted to recreate the harp of the legend by using the magic of the nature
- He tried to recreate the harp with the use of self made artifacts, runes.
- He destroyed villages, killed children, had various followers as he found the "way of the [[Rahnoer|Rahnoer]]"
- The party decided to return to the village, except [[Fanlyn|Fanlyn]] who mourned the loss of the forest. She hid ontop of a tree wildshaped as a squirrel
- Noticing that [[Fanlyn|Fanlyn]] was missing, [[Arcafang|Arcafang]] and [[Ntyss|Ntyss]] decided to go back to the forest to look for her.
- They found her after a while, sad and mourning.


## Paragraph
Noswada fragte einst seine Generäle
was sie als Anführer tun würden
um die Heimat zu beschützen. 
Sakoa würde eine Mauer errichten.
Nidri würde die Armee verstärken.
Ortai würde Fallen errichten.
Wasah würde sie mit Magie versiegeln.
