# Session Overview

The session began with the party waking up on a carriage, disoriented and unsure of how they got there. They were soon interrogated by mysterious figures, leading to a tense exchange of words that escalated into combat. Despite emerging victorious, the party sustained injuries. Intrigue heightened as a shapeshifter, possibly linked to [[Ntyss|Ntyss]]'s backstory, made a sudden appearance.

The ground cracked beneath them, transforming into a void, suggesting a shift in reality. Time briefly reversed, disorienting the party. [[Arcafang|Arcafang]] surprised everyone by willingly getting captured, possibly for strategic reasons. One party member cleverly bluffed their way out of danger.

[[Ntyss|Ntyss]] sacrificed themselves in a tragic battle, while [[Brieftasche|Brieftasche]] attempted to evade capture by hiding in a river and resorting to deception. [[Fanlyn|Fanlyn]] successfully rescued [[Arcafang|Arcafang]] and didn't bother saving [[Ntyss|Ntyss]] due to his counterproductive behaviour.

[[Brieftasche|Brieftasche]], showing an unpredictable nature, diverted from a rescue mission to commit arson in a building, creating chaos. He executed a daring escape, pursued by guards. [[Brieftasche|Brieftasche]] narrowly avoided capture by jumping off a high wall and even tried to charm a tree.

Now scattered, with [[Ntyss|Ntyss]] captured and [[Brieftasche|Brieftasche]] on a solo escapade, the party contemplates the consequences of their actions
