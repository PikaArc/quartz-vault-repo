# Sproute Village

## Overview
Sproute Village is a quaint and cozy settlement, nestled in a small clearing surrounded by open fields and plains. The village is relatively small, consisting of seven houses, an inn, and a bar. The fields nearby are primarily used for growing berries, adding a charming touch to the village's rustic charm.

Although the forest is not far from the village, it is situated at a comfortable distance, providing a measure of security for its inhabitants. A larger kingdom lies further away, but the villagers maintain a friendly relationship with their neighbors.
