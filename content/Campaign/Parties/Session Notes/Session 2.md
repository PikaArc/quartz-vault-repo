## During
### Events

The session unfolds with [[Fanlyn|Fanlyn]] and [[Arcafang|Arcafang]] executing a daring escape, relying on deception to slip away from their captors unnoticed. Meanwhile, [[Max|Max]] remains ensnared by a mysterious tree's enchantment, rendering him incapacitated. [[Ntyss|Ntyss]] finds himself facing interrogation by the bandit captain, his situation growing increasingly dire. However, just as the captain moves to seize [[Ntyss|Ntyss]], Laeroth breaks free from his restraints, shielding [[Ntyss|Ntyss]] from harm and initiating a fierce battle with the bandits alongside him.

The sudden appearance of Kantora, a mysterious figure with the ability to freeze time, provides a crucial distraction, allowing [[Ntyss|Ntyss]] and Laeroth to gain the upper hand in combat. Despite facing perilous odds, Laeroth falls in battle, only to be swiftly revived by his loyal mimic companion. With renewed determination, the party presses on, compelling a bandit named Chase to temporarily join their cause through intimidation.

Using Chase's deception, they mislead a barbarian about a stolen elixir, diverting his attention away from their escape. With the aid of an archer, the party manages to break out of the camp, discovering the truth about the mysterious tree â€“ it is revealed to be a mage named Fence concealed within its roots. Amidst the chaos, Laeroth raises the topic of a harp, sparking confusion among the party members, except for [[Ntyss|Ntyss]], who seems to possess some understanding of its significance.

Despite the confusion and uncertainty, the party resolves to follow Laeroth's lead, trusting in his knowledge and connections to guide them towards understanding their predicament. As tensions continue to rise and secrets begin to unravel, the party's journey takes an unexpected turn, leading them deeper into a tangled web of intrigue and danger.
