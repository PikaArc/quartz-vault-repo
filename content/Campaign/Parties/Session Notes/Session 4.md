#  [[../Party Dashboards/The Ionic Talk|The Ionic Talk]] Session 4 "The Shadowed Sigil: Unraveling Secrets and Confronting Darkness"
## Prep
### To-Do


## During
### Events

The day began with an unsettling wake-up call as [[Stretch|Stretch]] tossed [[Dris|Dris]]'s lifeless body into [[../Characters/Arcafang|Arcafang]]'s quarters, sparking immediate accusations of murder directed at the latter. [[../Characters/Fanlyn|Fanlyn]] Vizin, the group's keen investigator, promptly examined the corpse, revealing precise wounds hinting at a deadly weapon. The time of death was determined to be within the last few hours, and the discovery of peculiar dust added to the mystery. Additionally, a sigil found at the original crime scene deepened the intrigue.

Amidst the investigation, [[../Characters/Max|Max]] and [[../Characters/Fanlyn|Fanlyn]] took brief respites. [[../Characters/Max|Max]] sought sustenance but encountered culinary disappointment, while [[../Characters/Fanlyn|Fanlyn]] opted to forage for berries, stumbling upon an enigmatic phenomenon near a nearby dwelling. The arrival of [[Stretch|Stretch]] with a distressed woman whose daughter had vanished diverted attention momentarily, leading to a flurry of questions and attempts at consolation. However, [[../Characters/Fanlyn|Fanlyn]]'s subsequent investigation provided a critical lead, linking the disappearance to [[Goblin|goblin]] tracks and the strange sigil.

As the group pursued their inquiries, [[../Characters/Max|Max]]'s unconventional approach involved conversing with the local fauna, yielding unexpected insights. Meanwhile, [[../Characters/Fanlyn|Fanlyn]]'s pursuit of the [[Goblin|goblin]] tracks led her to a startling discovery: a buried [[Goblin|goblin]] bearing the same ominous sigil, reinforcing the connection to the mysterious events unfolding. Amidst these revelations, a sudden bout of slumber befell [[../Characters/Ntyss|Ntyss]], prompting an impromptu piggyback journey courtesy of [[../Characters/Max|Max]]. External commotion in the form of distant horns added to the growing tension, as did the return of Aleesia Enmar's long-absent husband, whose arrival seemed timed with suspicious precision.

A subsequent encounter with Armand Clarrel shed light on the supernatural forces at play, culminating in a perilous venture to a desolate forest and a fateful confrontation with the remnants of a dark ritual. Through a series of puzzles and perilous encounters, the party unraveled the mystery surrounding Noswada's malevolent legacy, culminating in a bittersweet victory tempered by the loss of both lives and the natural world. In the aftermath, as the group made their way back to the village, [[../Characters/Fanlyn|Fanlyn]], overcome with grief for the ravaged forest, sought solace amidst the branches, embodying a poignant moment of communion with nature. Concern for her well-being prompted [[../Characters/Arcafang|Arcafang]] and [[../Characters/Ntyss|Ntyss]] to embark on a search, ultimately finding her in a state of mourning, underscoring the emotional toll exacted by their harrowing ordeal.

### Travel & Rest

The path from the village to the forest spanned a serene hour-long walk in each direction, allowing the party a moment of reflection amidst nature's embrace.

### Loot, Rewards & Purchases

Amidst their trials, [[../Characters/Max|Max]] stumbled upon an intriguing dagger, its hilt adorned with intricate designs hinting at a storied past. Meanwhile, [[../Characters/Ntyss|Ntyss]] laid claim to a formidable sword discovered within the depths of the tomb, its blade whispering tales of ancient battles fought and won.

### Date & Time

As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting hues of crimson and gold across the land, the third day drew to a close. With weariness settling upon their shoulders like a heavy cloak, the party sought respite within the comforting walls of the inn, embracing the promise of a long-awaited rest.
