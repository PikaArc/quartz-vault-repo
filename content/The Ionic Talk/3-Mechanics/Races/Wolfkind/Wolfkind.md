## Wolfkind

### Physical Description

Big, strong, fast and wise, wolfkind are wolf-like humanoids; with wolfen ancestors. Their feet and hands are similar to those of the paws of their wolf ancestors, but their hands have evolved to be able to hold items. They are covered in fur like their lesser kin.

### History

The wolfkind are a race that swore to defend their pack at all costs. Few can remember how they came about but the pack elders say that it was during a time of great turmoil in the world that their kind were brought about. The elders tell stories of great battles, with both victories and defeats, and to these stories the younglings listen most eagerly. The more popular of these stories is that the wolfkind descended from the first of wolf-like therianthropes, though not necessarily lycanthropes. It is a bit murky, as they are not related to the true lycans that are associated with the goddess Selune, but likely perhaps a terrestrial spirit or deity.

### Society

Despite their brutal appearances; they are a people who cherish, and defend the lives of all good creatures as if they were their own. Their society functions similar to a typical society built by humans, however, they only kill another of their kind in ritualistic situations or in self-defense, if their fellow wolfkind has succumbed to evil, or disease.

### Names

A wolfkind's name is a rite of passage. A special ceremony is held to give a young wolf their name when they are old enough to finally help provide food and protection for the clan. As such, their names are typically unisex.

**Names:** Leslas, Ukrim, Ildrun, Daomri, Tusbo, Irvas, Naumdrik, Helgros, Urvas, Nagram

### Traits

Long-lived anthroporphic wolves, wolfkind are powerful hunters and fleet of foot.

#### Freezing Howl

As an action, you can unleash a magic-laced howl to debilitate those nearby.

### Forest Wolf

Once you use this ability, you must complete a short or [long rest](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/5e_SRD:Long_Rest "5e SRD:Long Rest") before you can do so again.  

### Racial Feats 

Created to help bring the race in line with other races that received such feats from XGtE. Balanced to be about as strong as Prodigy/Elven Accuracy.

#### Ultra Keen Senses

For a race known for its' sharp sense of smell and good hearing, you've found that in truth the average wolfkind is only beginning to tap into what their nose and ears can really do once honed.

You gain a [blindsight](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/5e_SRD:Blindsight "5e SRD:Blindsight") range of 30 feet.

Additionally, you gain expertise in [Perception](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/5e_SRD:Perception_Skill "5e SRD:Perception Skill"), or whichever skill of [Investigation](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/5e_SRD:Investigation_Skill "5e SRD:Investigation Skill"), [Nature](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/5e_SRD:Nature_Skill "5e SRD:Nature Skill"), or [Stealth](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/5e_SRD:Stealth_Skill "5e SRD:Stealth Skill") you selected when you chose this race.

#### Ties of the Pack

Considering that you're somewhere between 6 feet and 7 feet tall, can bite hard enough to remove an arm or leg from most victims, and are a member of a race that's the subject of both fear and awe among many other groups... You really love all your friends! And you let them know it. (Note: It is recommended this feat is only permitted if you already play with the Flanking rules for gaining advantage, as it is otherwise too strong)

As part of a [long rest](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/5e_SRD:Long_Rest "5e SRD:Long Rest"), you can bond with up to four willing allies. You can have up to four bonded allies at a time.

When you make an attack roll against an opponent within 5 feet of a bonded ally, you gain advantage on the attack roll.

If a bonded ally within 30 feet takes damage from an enemy, you can use your reaction to move up to your walking speed towards that enemy and make a melee weapon attack. You can do this a number of times equal to your [proficiency bonus](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/5e_SRD:Proficiency_Bonus "5e SRD:Proficiency Bonus"), regaining all uses on a [long rest](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/5e_SRD:Long_Rest "5e SRD:Long Rest").

#### Hunter's Evasion

Teamwork is essential to the success of any endeavor — this tenet is core to many Wolfkind's outlook on the world. Building upon this principle, you know that with the support of allies, you can stay nimble and keep each other much safer than if you stayed apart.

When you take the Dodge action, you can choose to also grant all friendly creatures within 10 feet of you the benefits of Dodge, as if they also took the action on their own turns. You can use this feature once, regaining use of it upon completing a [short](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/5e_SRD:Short_Rest "5e SRD:Short Rest") or [long rest](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/5e_SRD:Long_Rest "5e SRD:Long Rest").

Additionally, whenever you are forced to make a [Dexterity](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/5e_SRD:Dexterity "5e SRD:Dexterity") Saving Throw, you gain a +1 bonus to the roll for every [[1-Party]] member within 10 feet of you (maximum of +5). After damage you would take is determined, reduce the damage you take by 2 points for every [[1-Party]] member within 10 feet of yourself.
