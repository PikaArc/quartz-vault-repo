# Flower Description

At the twilight's edge, where day meets night and reality blurs into dreams, blooms the Twilight Tear, a tear-shaped flower that glistens with the dewdrops of dusk. Legends speak of its ability to conjure forth visions of the past and the future, offering solace to those who seek it. As the sun sets and darkness descends upon the [[feywilds]], the Tear unfolds its petals in a mesmerizing display of colors that shimmer like precious gems in the fading light. Its fragrance is subtle yet intoxicating, filling the air with a sense of tranquility and anticipation, as if the very essence of twilight itself were captured within its delicate blooms.
