# Session Overview

The day began with the group awakening to a sense of restlessness in the air. Tensions simmered between [[Arcafang]] and Max, culminating in a biting incident prompted by Max's incessant irritation of the former. Undeterred by the internal discord, the party resolved to push forward on their journey, opting for two to travel on horseback while the rest proceeded on foot.

As they traversed the landscape, a peculiar sensation permeated the air, drawing their attention to a mysterious figure shrouded in a hood. Only the glint of teeth hinted at the being's presence. Despite the eerie encounter, [[Laeroth]] remained unperturbed, leading the group onward.

Their path led them to a magical barrier, devoid of any discernible school of magic. While Max approached the enigmatic figure, their interaction was abruptly interrupted as the figure summoned a sea around itself, birthing five skeletal entities. Initially unnoticed by some, the skeletons inexorably advanced toward their companions, prompting a frantic realization of impending danger.

[[Fanlyn]]'s keen observation revealed a macabre connection between the figure and the skeletal minions, as strings tethered each skeleton to the entity. Battling against the skeletal assailants, the group fought valiantly, yet it became apparent that these foes were but a prelude to a greater threat.

Upon reaching a village, tensions escalated as [[Laeroth]]'s actions drew the ire of secretive individuals, identified only by the initials "A" and "E." Conflict ensued, revealing the clandestine nature of these figures' operations and their reluctance to involve outsiders. As arguments unfolded, the emergence of more skeletons intensified the chaos.

In the ensuing struggle, Max's attempt to evade the expanding barrier was thwarted by the reappearance of the enigmatic figure. Ice-cold waters enveloped Max as skeletal reinforcements poured forth, their onslaught seemingly unstoppable. Amidst the chaos, Darling's intervention provided a momentary reprieve, her familiarity with the figure hinting at a deeper connection.

The confrontation reached a climax as the figure's hand deteriorated with each summoning, culminating in the empowerment of a final, formidable skeletal adversary. Despite their valiant efforts, the group found themselves outmatched until Max, in a desperate bid for negotiation, struck a deal with the figure, promising to fulfill a mysterious task in exchange for safety.

With the barrier dissipating, the group sought refuge in a local inn, seeking respite from the day's harrowing events. As they retired to separate chambers, the echoes of their encounter lingered, hinting at the challenges yet to come on their journey.
