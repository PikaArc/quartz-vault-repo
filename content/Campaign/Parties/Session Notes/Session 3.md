#  [[../Party Dashboards/The Ionic Talk|The Ionic Talk]] Session 3 "Skeletons, Secrets, and Desperate Deals"
## Prep
### To-Do

As we approach the session, I'll review our party dynamics, especially keeping an eye on the tensions between [[../Characters/Arcafang|Arcafang]] and [[../Characters/Max|Max]]. I'll also make sure to have our character sheets updated and any relevant notes on hand for quick reference during gameplay.

## During
### Events

Today kicked off with tensions rising between [[../Characters/Arcafang|Arcafang]] and [[../Characters/Max|Max]], resulting in a biting incident. Despite the rough start, we decided to push forward on our journey. Along the way, we stumbled upon a mysterious hooded figure. There was an eerie vibe, and things escalated when [[../Characters/Max|Max]]'s curiosity triggered a confrontation, summoning skeletal entities that attacked us. [[../Characters/Fanlyn|Fanlyn]] noticed something peculiar â€“ strings connecting the skeletons to the hooded figure, adding to the mystery. Our journey led us to a village where things got even more intense. We clashed with secretive individuals known only as "A" and "E," and more skeletons showed up, escalating the conflict. [[../Characters/Max|Max]] tried to outsmart the barrier around the village but ended up in a dangerous face-off with the hooded figure. Thankfully, [[Darling|Darling]] intervened, hinting at a deeper connection with our mysterious adversary. The situation peaked when a powerful skeletal adversary emerged, pushing us to our limits. In a desperate move, [[../Characters/Max|Max]] negotiated with the hooded figure, striking a deal for our safety. With the barrier dissipating, we sought refuge in a nearby inn, trying to make sense of the chaos and reflect on what just happened.
