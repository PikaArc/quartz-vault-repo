# Flower Description

Hiding in the shadows of the [[feywilds]], where danger lurks and the boundary between predator and prey blurs into obscurity, blooms the Feybloom Flickertongue. This carnivorous flower boasts petals that twist and writhe like the tongue of a serpent, exuding an aura of danger and intrigue that captivates the imagination. Lurking beneath its enticing exterior lies a deadly trap, as unsuspecting prey are lured in by promises of nectar, only to be ensnared in its voracious hunger. Its scent carries a hint of decay and rot, a warning to those who would dare
